# Hi, I'm René Gaudoin

Computational scientist turned ML/RL practitioner (PhD in Quantum Monte Carlo, 7+ years at QuantumBlack/McKinsey — [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renegaudoin/), [CV](cv/rgaudoin.pdf)).

My core competency as a physicist: bridging the concrete and the abstract. Curious about science, current affairs, and fine wine (WSET 3 with distinction). [More about me →](ABOUT.md)

I'm particularly interested in pushing boundaries and developing novel solutions — going beyond descriptive and predictive modelling into RL, game theory, and deeper statistical applications. As a scientist I'm drawn to biomedical applications, but I'd love to one day combine science, ML, and my passion for fine wine (some ideas but nothing concrete yet).

I've long neglected my public GitHub. Recently, using spare time and Claude Code, I've started iterating on ideas that have been on the back burner for years. Most are still WIP, but a few are ready to share. Some started as science doodling (e.g. [bayesian-coin](https://github.com/RGaudoin/bayesian-coin), [cooperation-game](https://github.com/RGaudoin/cooperation-game)) — a reminder that even the seemingly obvious can surprise you.

If you're interested in collaboration, have questions, or constructive critique — please don't hesitate to get in touch.

## Topics & Projects

### Bayesian & Statistical Methods

- [discretiser](https://github.com/RGaudoin/discretiser) — Inspired by work on embeddings at QB and private discussions with researchers on generative modelling for patient pathways. Unified these ideas (including some relevant maths) into one framework. Public repo covers synthetic data, the general framework, and optimisation. The learning model remains private and experimental.

- [bayesian-coin](https://github.com/RGaudoin/bayesian-coin) — The beta prior framework we all think we know, right? On closer examination it doesn't match intuition. Fixable with hierarchical priors — including some that seem nonsensical at first glance.

### Reinforcement Learning & Game Theory

- [rd-boat](https://github.com/RGaudoin/rd-boat) — Inspired by observations from the America's Cup project on POMDP behaviour and pre-start strategy. A simple yet somewhat realistic boat simulator to explore these.

- [cooperation-game](https://github.com/RGaudoin/cooperation-game) — Started as daydreaming on what happens when agents with different abilities compete but can also cooperate. Expected higher ability to translate into more success — counterintuitively, even a simple model dispels that.
- *Private: bluff (multiplayer stochastic dice game sim), MCTS experiments (simple extension to infinite arms, exploring stochastic versions), POMDP experiments, RL bootstrapping and actor-critic architectures*

### Neural Networks

- *Private: genNN (custom layers for expressiveness with limited overfitting, distribution losses), dist_loss (exploring ideas for distribution-based losses)*

### Other

- *Private: wu-laoshi (app to accompany absolute beginners Mandarin — vocab, tones, interactive trainer), robopainter (exploring intrinsically generated creativity within my limited compute resources)*
