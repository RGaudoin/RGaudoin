# Hi, I'm René Gaudoin

Computational scientist turned ML/RL practitioner. PhD in Quantum Monte Carlo, 7+ years at QuantumBlack/McKinsey.

## Highlights

- **America's Cup 2021**: Deep RL for boat design optimisation (Team NZ, DataIQ Grand Prix winner)
- **Healthcare ML**: Real world evidence, survival analysis, RCT simulation
- **Research**: Quantum Monte Carlo, DFT, theoretical neurobiology

## On AI-assisted development

I have slight dyslexia – not an issue for reading or speaking (multilingual: English, German, Spanish), but writing at volume takes more effort. AI tools like Claude Code have been a genuine equaliser, letting me focus on ideas rather than wrestling with prose.

Productive use of AI pair programming with traditional engineering discipline – not "vibe coding" where review is bypassed.
