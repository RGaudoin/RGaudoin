# Hi, I'm René Gaudoin

Computational scientist turned ML/RL practitioner (PhD in Quantum Monte Carlo, 7+ years at QuantumBlack/McKinsey). My core competency as a physicist: bridging the concrete and the abstract. Curious about science, current affairs, and fine wine (WSET 3 with distinction). [More about me →](ABOUT.md)

I've long neglected my public GitHub. Recently, using spare time and Claude Code, I've started iterating on ideas that have been on the back burner for years. Most are still WIP, but a few are ready to share.

I'm particularly interested in pushing boundaries and developing novel solutions — going beyond descriptive and predictive modelling into RL, game theory, and deeper statistical applications. As a scientist I'm drawn to biomedical applications, but I'd love to one day combine science, ML, and my passion for fine wine.

If you're interested in collaboration, have questions, or constructive critique — please don't hesitate to get in touch.
