\section*{Personal Profile}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, nosep, itemsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{Objective:} Building innovative solutions that push technical boundaries --- exploring healthcare, science, fine wine, and beyond.

    \item \textbf{Strength:} Finding and implementing novel solutions based on diverse experience in academia and analytics consulting; driven by curiosity.

    \item \textbf{Academic background:} Research in computational science (solid state physics, quantum chemistry, public health, theoretical neurobiology).

    \item \textbf{Non-academic background:} DS/ML at QuantumBlack/McKinsey; online advertising; currently at StratosX.

    \item \textbf{Wine expertise:} Special prize at follow-up exam for all UK \href{https://www.wsetglobal.com/}{WSET} 3 graduates with 100\% score in 2016.

    \item \textbf{Highlights:} Deep Reinforcement Learning (\href{https://www.americascup.com/}{America's Cup 2021}, DataIQ Grand Prix), survival analysis and real world evidence on longitudinal medical data, deep neural network analysis of 1d medical data, randomised control trial simulation.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Professional Experience and Achievements}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, nosep, itemsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{Machine learning and statistical methods:} Reinforcement learning (supply chain optimisation, logistics, sailing); health care (public health, HES, real world evidence, randomised control trial simulations, drug discovery, marketing), GenAI (virtual agents, code generation, prompt engineering); deep learning \& DL surrogates, supervised/unsupervised tech stack (including causal modelling/inference; Bayesian stats etc.).

    \item \textbf{Developing new algorithms:} Calibration of statistical data, exact sampling for Quantum Monte Carlo, extending the Perceptron algorithm to time series of realistic neurons, modelling with aggregated target variable, and more.

    \item \textbf{Computational science:} Ab initio methods (DFT, post-HF, QMC) and their theoretical foundations, theoretical neurobiology, basic computational fluid dynamics.

    \item \textbf{Tech stack:} \textit{Languages:} Python, C, Fortran, Scala, some R, SQL. \textit{ML/Data:} TensorFlow, Ray/RLLib, Stable-Baselines, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, seaborn, matplotlib. \textit{Infrastructure:} Git, Linux, Jupyter, AWS, Databricks, Spark, Ray, Jira. \textit{Other:} \LaTeX.

    \item \textbf{AI-assisted development:} Productive use of AI pair programming (Claude Code) with traditional engineering discipline --- not vibe coding; also an equaliser for technical minds in written communication.
