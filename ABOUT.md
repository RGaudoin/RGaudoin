# About Me

*Placeholder — expand with more details about interests, background, philosophy.*

## Background

- PhD in Quantum Monte Carlo (Imperial College London)
- 7+ years at QuantumBlack/McKinsey
- Multilingual: English, German, Spanish

## Tech Stack

Python (TensorFlow, Ray/RLLib, pandas, scikit-learn), Scala, C, Fortran, SQL, Spark

## Interests Beyond Tech

- **Wine**: WSET Level 3 with distinction (100% score)
- **Current affairs**: FT, Economist
- **Science**: Broad curiosity beyond my field

## Philosophy

Being a physicist is my core competency:
1. The ability to translate between the real, concrete world and the abstract world of mathematics
2. The ability to quickly learn and do whatever it takes to achieve the above

## On AI-Assisted Development

I have slight dyslexia — not an issue for reading or speaking, but writing at volume takes more effort. AI tools like Claude Code have been a genuine equaliser, letting me focus on ideas rather than wrestling with prose.

Productive use of AI pair programming with traditional engineering discipline — not "vibe coding" where review is bypassed.
