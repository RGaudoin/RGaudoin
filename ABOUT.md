# About Me

## Background

- Dipl. Phys. TU Munich (thesis: learning algorithms for spiking neurons)
- PhD in Quantum Monte Carlo (Imperial College London)
- Postdoc at Dr Foster Unit, Imperial College (healthcare data, HES)
- 7+ years at QuantumBlack/McKinsey
- Currently CAIO at StratosX (airline disruption recovery); open to interesting opportunities
- Multilingual: English, German, Spanish

## Highlights

- **[America's Cup 2021](https://www.americascup.com/)**: Deep RL for boat design optimisation (Team NZ, DataIQ Grand Prix winner)
- **Healthcare ML**: Real world evidence, survival analysis, RCT simulation
- **Research**: Quantum Monte Carlo, DFT, theoretical neurobiology

## Tech Stack

Python (TensorFlow, Ray/RLLib, pandas, scikit-learn), Scala, C, Fortran, SQL, Spark

## Interests Beyond Tech

- **Wine**: WSET Level 3 with distinction (100% score, Oddbins Scholarship for top graduates)
- **Current affairs**: FT, Economist
- **Science**: Broad curiosity beyond my field

## Philosophy

Being a physicist is my core competency:
1. The ability to translate between the real, concrete world and the abstract world of mathematics
2. The ability to quickly learn and do whatever it takes to achieve the above

## On AI-Assisted Development

I have slight dyslexia — not an issue for reading or speaking, but writing at volume takes more effort. AI tools like Claude Code have been a genuine equaliser, letting me focus on ideas rather than wrestling with prose.

Productive use of AI pair programming with traditional engineering discipline — not "vibe coding" where review is bypassed.
